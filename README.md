* Live Site : https://react-course-app-88b8d.web.app/
* Server Side Code : https://github.com/shadmansaalim/Full-Stack-Course-Backend.git
* Implemented Firebase Authentication by which users can create account or login using Email & Password. Moreover, user can login with Google,Facebook & Twitter. 
* Users can look for courses and add them to their cart and from cart they can also review their order - Used Context API & Local Storage for state management
* Used Stripe Payment to let users pay for courses and also used Nodemailer for sending subscription mail to users.
* User's purchased courses will be automatically added to My Classes and user can give review to them which will be added to course details page instantly.
* Implemented Private Routes and a JWT Token to secure the application for this users can add course to their cart but cannot continue with the payment without logging. Moreover, no one can retreive individual user's data (e.g - My Classes) if he/she somehow gets the server API.
* Implemented basic Nielson Design Principles to improve the User Experience of the application.
* All the courses on UI are being generated dynamically from database. Moreover, users data are also being sent to database for which I built APIs on server side.
* I used React, React Bootstrap, NodeJs, ExpressJs and MongoDB to build this application.
* The application is fully 100% responsive for all devices
