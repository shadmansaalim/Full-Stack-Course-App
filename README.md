* Live Site : https://react-course-app-88b8d.web.app/ || Server Side Code : https://github.com/shadmansaalim/Full-Stack-Course-Backend.git
* Full Stack Course Based Application where users can create account using Email & Password or login if they are already a member. Moreover, to improve UX I also implemented Google,Facebook and Twitter authentication system.
* Users can look for courses and also can purchase them using any card which will be verified and for this I used Stripe Payment and after successfully purchasing users also get an email for which I used Nodemailer.
* Users can check the courses that they took on My Classes page and from there they can also even give a review to any course which will be instantly added to course details page.
* I also implemented Private Routes and a JWT Token to secure the application by this users can add course to their cart but cannot continue with the payment without logging. Moreover, no one can retreive individual user's data if he/she somehow gets the server API.
* I also implemented basic Nielson Design Principles to improve the User Experience of the application.
* All the courses on UI are being generated dynamically from database. Moreover, users data are also being sent to database for which I built APIs on server side.
* I used React, React Bootstrap, NodeJs, ExpressJs and MongoDB to build this application.
* The application is fully 100% responsive for all devices
